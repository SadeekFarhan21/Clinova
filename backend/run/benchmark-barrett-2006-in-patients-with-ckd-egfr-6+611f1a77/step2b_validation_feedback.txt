      "issue": "Time zero is defined as contrast administration time (t0), but the MDCT linking rule allows the qualifying CT procedure to occur up to +6 hours after t0 (I2/2.2). This makes eligibility potentially depend on post\u2013time-zero information, violating the baseline-only eligibility rule and the three-way coincidence test.",
      "fix": "Define a single 'scan episode' and set t0 to a timestamp that is guaranteed to be observable at baseline for both eligibility and assignment, e.g., t0 = min(CT procedure_datetime, contrast drug_exposure_start_datetime) (or require CT procedure_datetime <= drug_exposure_start_datetime + small tolerance). Then require the other record to fall within a symmetric window around this t0 without allowing eligibility-defining evidence to occur strictly after follow-up starts."

      "fix": "Either (a) define treatment by the first contrast agent at t0 and treat additional contrast agents as an intercurrent event (treatment-policy in primary; censoring sensitivity with IPCW), or (b) restrict the 'mixed exposure' check to concurrent/near-simultaneous administration that can be considered part of assignment at t0 (e.g., same timestamp or within 0\u201315 minutes)."

When the contrast drug_exposure timestamp precedes the CT procedure timestamp (still within the 6h linkage window), treatment assignment can occur before t0 (treatment_start < t0), meaning follow-up starts after treatment initiation (left truncation). This violates the three-way coincidence requirement and can exclude early post-contrast labs/events from the risk window.",
      "fix": "Redefine t0 to ensure treatment assignment time equals follow-up start. Recommended: set t0 = drug_exposure_start_datetime (contrast administration time) when available; require the qualifying CT/MDCT-with-contrast procedure to be linked within the same visit and within \u00b16h of t0 but do not allow procedure_datetime to define a later t0. If you require strict baseline-only eligibility timing, then either (a) require procedure_datetime <= t0 (and drop episodes where procedure is recorded after contrast), or (b) in datetime-aware mode, coarsen the episode to a single anchor (e.g., set both CT and contrast times to the same derived episode time) and update the machine-check rules so assignment_time == t0 and eligibility is asserted without using a post-t0 timestamp."
